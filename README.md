# CantonSwap – AMM & DEX Aggregator Prototype (Placeholder)

This repository serves as the placeholder prototype for **CantonSwap**, an AMM & DEX aggregator concept submitted to the **Canton Construct Ideathon**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
CantonSwap aims to solve the issue of **liquidity fragmentation** and **high slippage** on decentralized exchanges.  
The prototype focuses on:
- Smart-routing across multiple liquidity pools  
- Swap simulation preview  
- Low-fee optimized execution  
- Clean and simple user interface

This repository currently contains documentation and structure planning for the prototype.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Current decentralized exchanges often spread liquidity across many pools, causing:
- Unstable pricing  
- Higher slippage  
- Inefficient swaps  

Users must manually compare pools — a slow and error-prone process.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
CantonSwap introduces a smart-routing engine that:
- Aggregates liquidity from multiple AMMs  
- Simulates all possible swap routes  
- Selects the most cost-efficient path  
- Displays clear execution preview for transparency  

The goal is to provide a smooth, optimized, and user-friendly DEX experience on Canton.

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned)
- **Canton SDK**
- **Node.js / TypeScript**
- **AMM Smart Contract (prototype)**
- **React UI (lightweight frontend)**
- **Routing & simulation engine**

---

## 📌 Repository Content (Placeholder)
